# Static Analysis Tool for Detecting Security Vulnerabilities in Python Applications

A large class of vulnerabilities in applications originates in programs that enable user input information to
affect the values of certain parameters of security sensitive functions. In other words, these programs
encode a potentially dangerous information flow, in the sense that low integrity -- tainted -- information (user
input) may interfere with high integrity parameters of sensitive functions or variables (so called sensitive
sinks). This means that users are given the power to alter the behavior of sensitive functions or variables,
and in the worst case may be able to induce the program to perform security violations. For this reason,
such flows can be deemed illegal for their potential to encode vulnerabilities.

It is often desirable to accept certain illegal information flows, so we do not want to reject such flows
entirely. For instance, it is useful to be able to use the inputted user name for building SQL queries. It is
thus necessary to differentiate illegal flows that can be exploited, where a vulnerability exists, from those
that are inoffensive and can be deemed secure, or endorsed, where there is no vulnerability. One approach
is to only accept programs that properly sanitize the user input, and by so restricting the power of the user
to acceptable limits, in effect neutralizing the potential vulnerability.

The aim of this project is to study how web vulnerabilities can be detected statically by means of taint and
input sanitization analysis. We choose as a target web server side programs encoded in the Python
language.
